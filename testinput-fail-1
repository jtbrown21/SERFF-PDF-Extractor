Response\nObjection Letter Date 01/14/2025\nSubmitted Date 01/14/2025\nRespond By Date 02/14/2025\nDear Kelsea Olszewski,\nIntroduction:\nThank you for your objection response submission dated January 14, 2025. This filing remains provisionally disapproved\npending resolution of the following objections.\nObjection 1\n- Rules, null (Rate)\nComments: The rule pages still show the previously proposed, now-obsolete effective dates. Please revise them in both the\n"clean" and marked-up versions of the rule pages.\nObjection 2\n- Rate Disruption (Supporting Document)\nComments: Based on the information provided by the company, the Division finds little justification at the time for the dramatic\nincreases in premium for many of the models of vehicles which are represented among the 44 policies receiving the most adverse\nimpacts.\n(i) In regard to the most adversely affected policy, for a 2015 Ford Mustang Coupe 2D EcoBoost I4 Turbo, the customer in question, a\n27-year-old male, would go from paying $1,918.00 to $4,112.00 for a six-month, minimum-limits, liability-only policy. This customer is\nin ZIP Code 89074 in Henderson. He does not have any history of accidents or violations. The Ford Mustang EcoBoost, while it is\nconsidered a sports car, does not have a reputation for being particularly extreme or dangerous to operate. Even if there could be\nsaid to be some self-selection effect for more risk-seeking behavior among owners of that car, it would appear that this effect is\nalready captured in the $1,918 six-month premium, which is already quite expensive. For a liability-only policy at minimum limits,\npaying over $8,200 per year would appear to be unreasonably high, especially since the market value of a used 2015 Ford Mustang\nCoupe 2D EcoBoost I4 Turbo is in the range of $16,000 or slightly above. Thus, over two years of this insurance policy, the customer\nwould pay the entire amount that could have purchased another such vehicle.\nThe company also provided data showing that its Nevada loss ratio for the 2015 Ford Mustang has been 88.4%, or 0.98 of the overall\nloss ratio of 90%. The countrywide loss ratio for the 2015 Ford Mustang has been 74.3%, or 1.04 of the overall loss ratio of 71.2%.\nNeither of these loss-ratio relativities seems particularly extraordinary, hence another source of the Division's concern that the\nproposed increase appears to be unrelated to relevant empirical experience.\n(ii) For Nevada, the only vehicles that Root shows as having extremely adverse loss ratios are the Audi A4 and Q5, BMW 435i,\nJaguar XF, Maserati Ghibli, and RAM 1500, with the Chevrolet Camaro also having a somewhat poor loss ratio. On a countrywide\nbasis, particularly poor loss ratios are only observed for the BMW 435i and M4, as well as the Infiniti QX70. For many of the other\nvehicles represented among the 44 largest increases, the loss-ratio is even more favorable than the relevant overall loss ratio. While\nthe Division will give Root the benefit of the doubt with regard to the aforementioned models, for all of the others much more empirical\ndata would be needed in order for the Division to approve the substantial increases being proposed. For the models that show loss-\nratio relativities higher than 1, the Division may be open to approving increases that could reduce to 1 the greater of the Nevada or\ncountrywide loss ratios. However, any increases beyond that would require additional empirical support. For loss-ratio relativities that\nare less than 1 for both Nevada and countrywide experience, the Division would be hesitant to approve any increase at this time.\nConclusion:\nThis filing will be closed if no response is received within 30 days.

This filing remains provisionally disapproved\npending resolution of the following objections.\nObjection 1\n- Rates, null (Rate)\n- Rules, null (Rate)\n- Filing Memorandum (Supporting Document)\n- Rate Filing Data Summary (Supporting Document)\nComments: (i) The company needs to revise the effective dates for this filing by creating a Post-Submission Update to the\nGeneral Information tab. The effective date for new business should be after a reasonable future date of approval. The effective date\nfor renewal business should be at least 30 days after a reasonable future date of approval, to enable the company to send at least 30\ndays' advance notice of renewal to affected insureds, pursuant to NRS 687B.350.\n(ii) Please also revise the effective dates in the rate and rule pages (both clean and marked-up versions), the Filing Memorandum,\nNV PC Form 1 - Part 2, and any other filing documentation where they are mentioned.\nObjection 2\n- Rate Disruption (Supporting Document)\nComments: (i) With respect to the vehicle proposed to receive the largest percentage increase (+114.390%), is this a regular\n2015 Ford Mustang, or an upgraded version, such as a 2015 Ford Mustang GT?\n(ii) It appears that one contributor to the increases for the policies with both the largest dollar change and the largest percentage\nchange is a significant increase in the Rental coverage factor (+276.7% for the policy with the largest dollar increase and +65.3% for\nthe policy with the largest percentage increase). However, it does not appear that the cost of rental coverage would vary materially by\nvehicle, since the insurer's obligation to pay for a rental vehicle is limited to a daily dollar amount and a fixed number of days,\nirrespective of the make/model/cost of the vehicle that is unavailable to the insured for the duration of the rental. Why would the cost\nof Rental coverage vary materially by vehicle symbol?\nObjection 3\n- Rate Disruption (Supporting Document)\nComments: The company provided the make/model combinations of the vehicles receiving the minimum and maximum\nimpacts, but it is not clear whether these are the vehicles that would be receiving those impacts in the company's Nevada book of\nbusiness in particular.\nThe Rate Disruption shows 44 insureds proposed to receive increases in excess of 40%; most of this impact is presumably due to\nsymbol changes.\nPlease provide the year, make, and model of each of those 44 policyholders' vehicles. For each unique make/model combination,\nplease also provide the earned premium, incurred losses, loss ratio, and loss-ratio relativity for both recent (2020 or later) Nevada\nexperience and the company's recent (2020 or later) countrywide experience.\nSERFF Tracking #: CLIN-134324648 State Tracking #: 124310 Company Tracking #: NV-RIC-PPA-RATES-202411\nState: Nevada Filing Company: Root Insurance Company\nTOI/Sub-TOI: 19.0 Personal Auto/19.0001 Private Passenger Auto (PPA)\nProduct Name: NV Rate/Rule\nProject Name/Number: /\nPDF Pipeline for SERFF Tracking Number CLIN-134324648 Generated 05/22/2025 02:35 PM\n\nConclusion:\nThis filing will be closed if no response is received within 30 days.

Include a\npercentage distribution of all scorable insureds and demonstrate that No Hit/No Score assignments are no more adverse than the\n50th percentile of scorable insureds.\nObjection 2\n- Rates, null (Rate)\n- Rate Filing Data Summary (Supporting Document)\nComments: The proposed base rate values on page 1 of the NV RFD document appear to have increased by higher\npercentages than stated within the NVPC form 1- part 2. Collision coverage rate increased by 23.690%, Comprehensive increased by\n14.931%, PD and Med pay increased a little over 1%. Please explain why this is so and correct any errors.\nObjection 3\n- Rate Disruption (Supporting Document)\nComments: The symbol % impact for both the largest percentage and dollar increase appears to be extremely high. Please\nprovide a breakdown of the attributes(coverage specific) contributing to the high symbol % impact and it corresponding dollar change.\nObjection 4\n- Vin Table, null (Rate)\nComments: In addition to the VIN number, please provide in plain language which makes and models are receiving extremely\nlarge increases to their factors, as well as the makes and models receiving large decreases to their factors.\nPlease explain why the proposed factors for some coverages are 2x to 3x their existing factors when it is stated within the model\ndocumentation that factors are capped at +/-15% of their existing factors.\nObjection 5\nComments: It is stated on pages 6 and 7 that final _factor = , Then for factors associated with short VINs in our book, we\ncapped the final factor to +/- 15% of the existing factor.\n(i) Are the proposed factors stated within the NV VIN Tables spreadsheets solely as a result of the above process or some are based\non company decisions?\n(ii) The company should confirm that no uncapped decreases will result in capped increases as this is not permitted by the Division.\nConclusion:\nThis filing will be closed if no response is received within 30 days.

This customer is in ZIP Code 89074 in Henderson. He does not have any history of accidents orviolations. The Ford Mustang EcoBoost, while it is considered a sports car, does not have a reputation for being particularly extreme or dangerous to operate. Even if therecould be said to be some self-selection effect for more risk-seeking behavior among owners of that car, it would appear that this effect is already captured in the $1,918 six-month premium, which is already quite expensive. For a liability-only policy at minimum limits, paying over $8,200 per year would appear to be unreasonably high, especiallysince the market value of a used 2015 Ford Mustang Coupe 2D EcoBoost I4 Turbo is in the range of $16,000 or slightly above. Thus, over two years of this insurance policy, thecustomer would pay the entire amount that could have purchased another such vehicle.The company also provided data showing that its Nevada loss ratio for the 2015 Ford Mustang has been 88.4%, or 0.98 of the overall loss ratio of 90%. The countrywide lossratio for the 2015 Ford Mustang has been 74.3%, or 1.04 of the overall loss ratio of 71.2%. Neither of these loss-ratio relativities seems particularly extraordinary, hence anothersource of the Division's concern that the proposed increase appears to be unrelated to relevant empirical experience.(ii) For Nevada, the only vehicles that Root shows as having extremely adverse loss ratios are the Audi A4 and Q5, BMW 435i, Jaguar XF, Maserati Ghibli, and RAM 1500, withthe Chevrolet Camaro also having a somewhat poor loss ratio. On a countrywide basis, particularly poor loss ratios are only observed for the BMW 435i and M4, as well as theInfiniti QX70. For many of the other vehicles represented among the 44 largest increases, the loss-ratio is even more favorable than the relevant overall loss ratio. While theDivision will give Root the benefit of the doubt with regard to the aforementioned models, for all of the others much more empirical data would be needed in order for the Divisionto approve the substantial increases being proposed. For the models that show loss-ratio relativities higher than 1, the Division may be open to approving increases that couldreduce to 1 the greater of the Nevada or countrywide loss ratios. However, any increases beyond that would require additional empirical support. For loss-ratio relativities thatare less than 1 for both Nevada and countrywide experience, the Division would be hesitant to approve any increase at this time.\nChanged Items:\nNo Form Schedule items changed.No Rate/Rule Schedule items changed.\nSERFF Tracking #:\n \nCLIN-134324648\n \nState Tracking #:\n \n124310\n \nCompany Tracking #:\n \nNV-RIC-PPA-RATES-202411\nState:\n \nNevada\n \nFiling Company:\n \nRoot Insurance Company\nTOI/Sub-TOI:\n \n19.0 Personal Auto/19.0001 Private Passenger Auto (PPA)\nProduct Name:\n \nNV Rate/Rule\nProject Name/Number:\n \n/\nPDF Pipeline for SERFF Tracking Number CLIN-134324648 Generated 05/22/2025 02:35 PM\n\nSupporting Document Schedule Item ChangesSatisfied - Item:\n \nRate Disruption\nComments:Attachment(s):\nMax Min Vehicle VIN Factors.pdfVIN Max Factor Change.pdfYear Make Model Loss Ratios.pdfNevada Rate Disruption.pdf\nPrevious Version\nSatisfied - Item:\nRate Disruption\nComments:Attachment(s):\nNV Rate Disruption.pdfMax Min Vehicle VIN Factors.pdfVIN Max Factor Change.pdfYear Make Model Loss Ratios.pdf\nPrevious Version\nSatisfied - Item:\nRate Disruption\nComments:Attachment(s):\nNV Rate Disruption.pdfMax Min Vehicle VIN Factors.pdfVIN Max Factor Change.pdf\nPrevious Version\nSatisfied - Item:\nRate Disruption\nComments:Attachment(s):\nNV Rate Disruption.pdf\nConclusion:\nSincerely,Luda Shulayev\nSERFF Tracking #:\n \nCLIN-134324648\n \nState Tracking #:\n \n124310\n \nCompany Tracking #:\n \nNV-RIC-PPA-RATES-202411\nState:\n \nNevada\n \nFiling Company:\n \nRoot Insurance Company\nTOI/Sub-TOI:\n \n19.0 Personal Auto/19.0001 Private Passenger Auto (PPA)\nProduct Name:\n \nNV Rate/Rule\nProject Name/Number:\n \n/\nPDF Pipeline for SERFF Tracking Number CLIN-134324648 Generated 05/22/2025 02:35 PM\n\nResponse Letter\nResponse Letter Status\n \nSubmitted to State\nResponse Letter Date\n \n01/14/2025\nSubmitted Date\n \n01/14/2025\nDear Mavis Quansah Amissah,\nIntroduction:Response 1\nComments:\nWe have revised our effective dates in all relevant filing documents.\nRelated Objection 1\nApplies To:- Filing Memorandum (Supporting Document)- Rate Filing Data Summary (Supporting Document)- Rates, null (Rate)- Rules, null (Rate)Comments: (i) The company needs to revise the effective dates for this filing by creating a Post-Submission Update to the General Information tab.

However, it does not appear that thecost of rental coverage would vary materially by vehicle, since the insurer's obligation to pay for a rental vehicle is limited to a daily dollar amount and a fixed number of days,irrespective of the make/model/cost of the vehicle that is unavailable to the insured for the duration of the rental.
