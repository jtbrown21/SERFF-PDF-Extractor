Filing Description:
The Hartford is introducing a newer version of their proprietary symbols manual that is used in Private Passenger Auto vehicle
rating. This is a refresh of our existing symbols model. With this model refresh, we brought in more recent data, assessed
overall model performance, monitored existing variables and tested new variables to fit in the model. These proprietary
symbols create more equitable rates by aligning the vehicle relativities to the expected loss experience of each unique vehicle
within a model year. This will affect new business policies beginning May 2, 2024 and renewal policies beginning June 23,
2024. Included in this filing are the symbol assignment pages.
The proprietary symbol set included in this manual includes symbols assigned to each of the seven major coverages in use
countrywide: Bodily Injury, Property Damage, Medical Payments, Personal Injury Protection, Uninsured Motorists,
Comprehensive and Collision.
This Symbol Filing is submitted in conjunction with the Rate and Rule Filing found in # HART-133937777.
Attached please find the proposed symbol assignment pages. The effective date of all pages enclosed is reflected in the
document title.
