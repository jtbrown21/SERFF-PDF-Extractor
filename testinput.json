The Company states that “Exhibit B-3 details the various adjustments made to the modeling\ndata to make it more reasonable for use in the proposed models. Some data fields were\nadjusted because values had to be imputed when information was missing. Several data fields\nwere not available from any data source and were simulated as documented in Exhibit B-1.”\nHowever, after reviewing Exhibit B-3 and B-1, there is a mismatch on number of data fields\nlabeled “simulated” and those listed in Exhibit B-3.

The first utilizes the previously established methodology\nfor assigning symbols to individual VINs and incorporates more recent loss experience for the individual VINs. This is the\nupdate that was originally included in and approved with the original submission of filing USAA-132971631.\nThe second set of changes is based on a supplemental analysis for Collision and Comprehensive coverages on select\nvehicles. These updates account for recent shifts observed in our loss experience that reflect known changes in the claims\nenvironment.\nOur symbol assignments by VIN can be found in the attached manual pages. Updated symbol assignments due to new\nvehicles or updated vehicle characteristics will be appended onto the Symbol Assignment Database as available.\nFiling Contact Information\nMarielis Pineiro, State Filings Advisor II marielis.pineiro@usaa.com\n9800 Fredericksburg Rd\nSan Antontio, TX 78288\n210-387-7466 [Phone]\nSERFF Tracking #: USAA-133943045 State Tracking #: Company Tracking #: GA2400006\nState: Georgia First Filing Company: United Services Automobile Association, ...\nTOI/Sub-TOI: 19.0 Personal Auto/19.0001 Private Passenger Auto (PPA)\nProduct Name: GA Auto Rule Revision\nProject Name/Number: V6 Symbols/2023-04-0036\nPDF Pipeline for SERFF Tracking Number USAA-133943045 Generated 05/21/2025 10:00 AM\n\nFiling Company Information\nUnited Services Automobile\nAssociation\n9800 Federicksburg Road\nSan Antonio, TX 78288\n(800) 531-8722 ext.

This\nchange will be effective for new business policies written on or after May 2, 2024 and will affect renewal policies effective on or\nafter June 23, 2024. The overall impact of the proposed changes is 9.9%.\nWith this filing, we are updating Base Rates, Renewal Rate Cap, and Full Safety Glass Coverage. In addition to changing the\nlisted rates, we have included a new version of our Telematics Program rate tables reflecting our reformatted table structure\n(there is no changing to the factors). We have also made various grammatical/punctuation/capitalization as well as material\nadjustments to our Rule Manual.\nWith this filing, The Hartford is adopting subsequent (1.1) version of the Cambridge Mobile Telematics Score for use in the\nNutmeg Insurance Company, which was approved/acknowledged by the Department under SERFF # FRCS-133159805.\nThe Hartford is introducing a newer version of their proprietary symbols manual that is used in Private Passenger Auto vehicle\nrating. This is a refresh of our existing symbols model and details can be found in corresponding filing HART-133937920.\nAttached please find the proposed rate and rule pages for this revision.\nFiling Contact Information\nShane Gemelli, shane.gemelli@thehartford.com\nThe Hartford\nATTN: T-8 ARIBA PROCESSING\n1 Hartford Plaza\nHartford, CT 06155\n860-547-5713 [Phone]\nFiling Company Information\nNutmeg Insurance Company\nHartford Plaza\nHartford, CT 06155\n(860) 547-5000 ext.

This is a refresh of our existing symbols model. With this model refresh, we brought in more recent data, assessed\noverall model performance, monitored existing variables and tested new variables to fit in the model. These proprietary\nsymbols create more equitable rates by aligning the vehicle relativities to the expected loss experience of each unique vehicle\nwithin a model year. This will affect new business policies beginning May 2, 2024 and renewal policies beginning June 23,\n2024. Included in this filing are the symbol assignment pages.\nThe proprietary symbol set included in this manual includes symbols assigned to each of the seven major coverages in use\ncountrywide: Bodily Injury, Property Damage, Medical Payments, Personal Injury Protection, Uninsured Motorists,\nComprehensive and Collision.\nThis Symbol Filing is submitted in conjunction with the Rate and Rule Filing found in # HART-133937777.\nAttached please find the proposed symbol assignment pages.
